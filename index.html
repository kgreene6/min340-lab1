            Dean Koontz is one of my favorite authors.  He creates such an interesting story involving all sorts of fiction.  My favortite books of his are Lighting and the Odd Thomas series.

            My favorite color is blue but the light blue that you see in ice or snow.  It is not as intnense and is very calming to me.

            I enjoy listening to showtunes rather than regular music on the radio.  I love to watch musicals so when I hear the showtunes I can picture the stories. Some of my favorite musicals are Into the Woods, Once, and Seussical.

            Whenever I have a day where I feel down, I will most likely draw or read to fee better.  These activities help keep my focus and I will only worry about what is going on with my drawing or book.  I usually accompany these with listening to music as well.

            Not only am I a Media Informatics major at NKU but I also have a minor in Visual Arts.  I can paint, wheel throw, sculpt, and draw.  I mostly focus on drawing and I am currently in an Advanced Drawing class.

            One last interesting thing about me is that I am a current employee at the Cincinnati Circus Company, it is one of my 3 jobs.  I went into this job only knowing how to face paint.  Now I can do silk acrobatics, stilt walk, juggle, run a roulette table, and make just a few terrible balloon animals.  It is such a fun job and not a common one!
